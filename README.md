# 🕳️ Pothole Detection Presented by Hapihygi Innovations......

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **real-time pothole detection system** using **YOLOv11-S**, a lightweight and efficient object detection model. The goal is to automatically identify potholes on roads from images or video feeds, enabling early maintenance and improving road safety.

## 🎯 Objective
- To develop a robust computer vision model that can detect potholes with high accuracy in various road and lighting conditions.  
- To assist municipalities, drivers, and autonomous vehicles in identifying hazardous road conditions efficiently.  
- To automate road inspection using AI-powered vision systems.

## 🧠 Model and Approach
- The model used in this project is **YOLOv11-S**, trained from scratch and fine-tuned on multiple pothole detection datasets.  
- The training process involved data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal accuracy and inference speed.  
- The final model can detect potholes in both **images** and **real-time video streams**.
